BrainFuck Compiler Implementation in C

<b>
> Increment Pointer <br>
< Decrement Pointer <br>
- Decrement Value in Current Pointer <br>
+ Decrement Value in Current Pointer <br>
. Print Value in Current Pointer as Character <br>
{ Print Value in Current Pointer as Integer (Very Useful while debugging) <br>
, Input Value as Charachter <br>
} Input Value as Integer <br>

<h4> Difference Between traditional BrainFuck Compiler and this one </h4>

BrainFuck Compiler uses fixed size of 1 byte array to store data. <br>
If you will use more than allocated memory than your program could crash. <br>
And usage of less memory than allocated is wastage of memory. <br>
Mine Compiler uses dynamically allocated array which increases size of array according to need <br>
 <br>
This compiler Provides input and output feature as Integer <br>
 <br>
C source code generated by this compiler is more readable <br>

<h4> USAGE </h4>
./BrainFuck source.bf output.exe
